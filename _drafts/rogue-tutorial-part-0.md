This is a traditional roguelike tutorial written for Gamemaker that will follow the format and structure of the Python rogue tutorial.

Because of differences in engines and in order to make it as useful as possible for Gamemaker devs there will be a couple of differences.

1. We will use traditional sprites instead of ASCII characters for art. While we could use text, because Gamemaker makes sprite operations so easy it would be a miss to not take advantage of it. This also makes the tutorial as accessible for Gamemaker developers as possible.
2. Instead of using a library for some advanced functions like line of sight and pathfinding, we will build our own in Gamemaker GML. The reason for this is it removes any dependencies that might come out of date and allows the learner to have full control over all the code.
3. We will try to follow a similar code structure as the Python tutorial. This does mean that some of the code will look slightly different from traditional Gamemaker tutorials. We will cover those moments specifically and discuss why we are organizing our code a particular way. Because of this, this will most likely be an "Intermediate" level tutorial. The steps will be clearly written so a beginner can follow along but some of the reasoning behind the approaches might be confusing if you are just starting out. Try your best and things will make more sense the further you progress in the series.


What will I learn if I plug through this:
* Turn based games in game maker
* The foundations of a traditional roguelike in gamemaker
* Procedural generation
* Line of sight algorithms
* Different intermediate level code structure techniques
*
