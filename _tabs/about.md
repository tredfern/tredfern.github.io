I am a programmer, sound designer, and founder at [Short Leg Studio](https://shortlegstudio.com). We are a small indie studio that is making games with a focus on creativity.

I like making and playing games, walking my corgis, and playing music. You can find my music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ENKhR6BIJbJEOvDvyAjL5?si=5vKfCKahSqe-cUd3bnNxtQ) and other music platforms.
